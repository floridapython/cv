    <!-- the <i> + </i> tag italicizes the words but doesn't do anything else
    the <em> + </em> tag italicizes the words and also tells the browser that it is important and emphasizes it

    this is the same thing with the <b> + </b> and the <strong> + </strong> tags. The <b> tag being just the styling
    while the <strong> tag tells the browser that the information is important

    you can see how we added a hyperlink to the florida state university text, we used the <a> + </a> tags
    and then added href = "our link" and then left our hyper link text between the tags >-->
